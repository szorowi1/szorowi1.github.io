I am a clinical biostatistician working with [Dr. Angela Langdon](https://ajlangdon.github.io/) at the National Institute of Mental Health. I lead the design and analysis of human behavioral research in the [Unit on the Neural Computations in Learning](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-conducted-at-nimh/principal-investigators/angela-langdon-phd).

I received my Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Princeton University in 2023, advised by [Yael Niv](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/) and [Nathaniel Daw](https://dawlab.princeton.edu/). In my doctoral research, I studied the structure of individual-differences in reinforcement learning using cognitive and structural equation modeling.

I am broadly interested in psychometrics and statistical approaches for analyzing all types of clinical data (e.g., self-report, behavioral, neural). I also build software to make science easier (e.g., [jspsych-demos](https://nivlab.github.io/jspsych-demos), [OpenData](https://nivlab.github.io/opendata)).
