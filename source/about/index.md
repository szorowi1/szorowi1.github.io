I am a PhD candidate at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute advised by Yael Niv and Nathaniel Daw. My research focus is at the intersection of psychometrics, reinforcement learning, and computational psychiatry. I work on projects that aim to improve our measurement and understanding of psychiatric symptoms like pessimistic appraisals, excessive avoidance, and interminable worry.
