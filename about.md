<p>I am a second year Ph.D student at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute studying under Professors <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~nivlab/">Yael Niv</a> and <a href="https://dawlab.princeton.edu/">Nathaniel Daw</a>. My research interests lie somewhere at the intersection of reinforcement learning, computational psychiatry, and human neuroimaging. Right now, I work on projects that seek to offer computational accounts of the core symptoms of anxiety disorders, such as pessimistic inference, pathological avoidance, and biased attention.</p>

<p>Other assorted academic facts: My side gigs are in Bayesian modeling and statistics, and increasingly in cog neuro methods development. I really enjoy teaching. I am secretly into public health and philosophy.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I care deeply about issues surrounding mental health. As a native son of New Jersey, I have a fondness for bad punk music and self-deprecating humor.</p>
