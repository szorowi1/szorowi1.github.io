<p>I am a second year Ph.D student at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute
studying under Professors <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~nivlab/">Yael Niv</a>
and <a href="https://dawlab.princeton.edu/">Nathaniel Daw</a>. My research
interests lie somewhere at the intersection of reinforcement learning,
computational psychiatry, and human neuroimaging. Right now, I work on projects
that seek to offer computational accounts of the core symptoms of anxiety disorders,
such as pessimistic inference, pathological avoidance, and context conditioning.</p>

<p>Other assorted academic facts: I have a background in Bayesian modeling
and statistics (i.e. I won't shut up about
<a href="https://github.com/nivlab/stan-examples">Stan</a>).
I dabble in cognitive neuroscience methods development
(<a href="https://github.com/nivlab/NivLink">NivLink</a>). I care a lot about
open science practices and really enjoy teaching
(<a href="https://github.com/szorowi1/qmss2017">python workshop</a>). I
have past lives in public health research and academic philosphy.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I am passionate about mental health and illness. I worked
for three years in the Department of Psychiatry at Mass General, and have been
volunteering with mental health organizations for a decade. As a native
son of New Jersey, I have a fondness for bad punk music and self-deprecating humor.</p>
