<p>I am a fourth year Ph.D student at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute advised by <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~nivlab/">Yael Niv</a> and <a href="https://dawlab.princeton.edu/">Nathaniel Daw</a>. My current work is focused on reinforcement learning, computational psychiatry, and psychometrics. I work on projects that aim to formalize psychopathological symptoms such as pessimistic evaluation, excessive avoidance, and interminable worry.</p>

<p>More broadly, I'm interested in cognitive modeling, statistics, and methods development. I also enjoy teaching, public health, and philosophy.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I care deeply about mental health issues. I also have an inadvisable fondness for bad punk music and self-deprecating humor.</p>
