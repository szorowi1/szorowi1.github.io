<p>I am a second year Ph.D student at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute studying under Professors <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~nivlab/">Yael Niv</a> and <a href="https://dawlab.princeton.edu/">Nathaniel Daw</a>. My research interests lie somewhere at the intersection of reinforcement learning, computational psychiatry, and human neuroimaging. Right now, I work on projects that seek to offer computational accounts of the core symptoms of anxiety disorders, such as pessimistic inference, pathological avoidance, and context conditioning.</p>

<p>Other assorted academic facts: I have a background in Bayesian modeling and statistics. I dabble in cognitive neuroscience methods development. I care a lot about open science practices and really enjoy teaching. I have past lives in public health research and academic philosophy.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I am passionate about mental health issues, and have been volunteering with various mental health organizations for years. As a native son of New Jersey, I have a fondness for bad punk music and self-deprecating humor.</p>
