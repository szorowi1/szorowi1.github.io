<p>I am a third year Ph.D student at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute studying under Professors <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~nivlab/">Yael Niv</a> and <a href="https://dawlab.princeton.edu/">Nathaniel Daw</a>. My research interests lie somewhere at the intersection of reinforcement learning, computational psychiatry, and psychometrics. Right now, I work on projects that aim to formalize the core symptoms of anxiety disorders, such as pessimistic evaluation, persistent avoidance, and interminable worry.</p>

<p>More broadly, I'm interested in cognitive modeling, Bayesian statistics, and increasingly neuroscience methods development. I also enjoy teaching, public health, and philosophy.</p>

<p>Outside of research, I care deeply about issues surrounding mental health. As a native son of New Jersey, I have a fondness for bad punk music and self-deprecating humor.</p>
