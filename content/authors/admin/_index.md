I am a Staff Applied Scientist at [Cohere Health](https://coherehealth.com/). I completed my PhD in Computational Neuroscience at Princeton University where I studied precision psychiatry, reinforcement learning, and measurement theory. 

I develop statistical models for measuring patient health and recommending treatments. In my work, I use a variety of methodological approaches including Bayesian data analysis and decision theory, statistical optimzation, and large-language models.
