[Strange, the passage of time.](https://johnmulaneyoutofcontext.tumblr.com/post/175497092259) In an attempt to preserve some memory of this PhD (which is proceeding much too quickly), I'm going to try to write monthly updates of what I've done and where I'm at.

On October 1st, I took and successfully completed my qualifying exams (hooray). For the remainder of the month, I... did close to nothing. Not absolutely nothing, but pretty darn close to nothing. Not because I really wanted to do nothing, but because I found myself struggling to do anything.

You see, the months leading up to exams were busy. I attended and presented at my first academic conference of grad school. I completed and submitted my [first paper of grad school](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/724492v1.abstract). I published the last outstanding paper from my time as an RA. I organized and co-taught a [boot camp](https://github.com/zashwood/pni_bootcamp_2019) for the incoming 1st year grad students. I put together all of the pieces of my first experiment. I moved my partner to another country and got her settled in. And finally, for my exams, I read many, many dozens of papers, designed three new experiments, and defended them over 2 hours to a three-member faculty committee.

So by the time October 2nd came around, I was wrecked. I was incapable of maintaining attention for more than 30-45 minutes. I couldn't look at screens for extended periods of time. My usual excitement for analysis and coding was completely missing. I found it difficult to express myself in conversation. I felt lethargic and had trouble getting out of bed. The projects I had spent months thinking about suddenly seemed like garbage to me. I was burned out.

At first I tried to fight through it, but I eventually gave up and accepted the fact I needed time to recharge. So for most of October I relaxed. I watched TV (especially GBBO). I played video games (WoW classic). I read a lot of books (I especially enjoyed Esme Weijun Wang's *The Collected Schizophrenias*, Havi Carel's *Illness*, and Hernan Diaz's *In The Distance*). Most importantly, I slept a lot.

By the end of October, things started to get better. My projects began to seem exciting again and I felt motivated to get back to work. I ended the month genuinely looking forward to this next stage of the PhD.
