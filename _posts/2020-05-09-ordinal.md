Inspired by [Baez-Ortega (2018)](https://baezortega.github.io/2018/05/28/robust-correlation/), I wrote a brief tutorial today on [robust ordinal regression](https://github.com/nivlab/stan-examples/blob/master/Ordinal/tutorial.ipynb) in Stan. The short of it is that you can protect yourself against outliers by using the [cauchit link](https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/jmasm/vol18/iss1/20/) in place of the usual probit or logit link functions.
