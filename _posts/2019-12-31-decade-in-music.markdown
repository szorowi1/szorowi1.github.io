> "One of the best things about music is its ability to grant us access to our emotions in ways nothing else can."

Probably like most other people, I have a reciprocal relationship with music. On any given day what I'm thinking or how I'm feeling changes what music I'm pulled towards; in turn, the music I listen to then shapes how I process those same thoughts and feelings. In this way, music is inextricably tangled up in my identity and how I remember myself.

Because my memory is usually poor, I wanted to write for myself a list of the albums that meant the most to me in the 2010s. The albums on this list are not necessarily the best this decade had to offer. Instead these are the albums that best capture who I was at specific points over the last ten years.

(To note, these are organized not by when they came out but by when they first became meaningful to me.)

------------------

### Low, _C'mon_ (2011)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0943396085_16.jpg"></p>

The soundtrack to many late night walks through Baltimore my freshman year. [Witches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grrsh7rGzv4) and [Especially Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBtJpVY7NkE) still knock me dead.

### Waxahatchee, _American Weekend_ (2012)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0069470205_16.jpg"></p>

Katie Crutchfield wrote American Weekend in 2011 "as a result of a snowstorm, a visceral stupor, and a personal breakthrough". In retrospect, it's no surprise this was the album I turned to, lost and depressed, one cold winter in Indiana.  

### Typhoon, _White Lighter_ (2013)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0323736272_16.jpg"></p>

A meditation on mortality, fatalism, grief, and ultimately acceptance. I can't describe here exactly what this album means to me, but suffice it to say that it accompanied me for the only time in my life I've ever felt spiritual.

### Angel Olson, _Burn Your Fire for No Witness_ (2014)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0472423704_16.jpg"></p>

I can pinpoint precisely the moment when BYFFNW first set my brain on fire (Jan 2nd, 2014, 7:30am, Midway Airport), and different tracks off the album have engulfed me unexpectedly at various points in the year since then.

### Mogwai, _Les Revenants_ (2013)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/1358979989_4pa8p2.jpg"></p>

Mogwai is one of the few bands I've been listening to since high school. Though this isn't my favorite of their albums, it's weirdly the one I've listened to the most. I listened to [Wizard Motor's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFHlvaL0HtU) ominous melody for hours this decade.

### Titus Andronicus, _The Monitor_ (2010)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2010/03/titus-andronicus-the-monitor-aa-608x608.jpg"></p>

Working seven days a week, in a toxic relationship, and living through Boston's snowiest winter on record, I would walk for hours every night blasting this album through my earbuds as loud as I could stand. Titus Andronicus forever.

### Mitski, _Bury Me at Makeout Creek_ (2014)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3943051749_16.jpg"></p>

In exactly 30 minutes, Mitski delivers some of the most beautiful songs about [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovFVapCtMHo), [depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssVf326Ox9g), and [despondency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F_k5uBnYGo). This album will give me a panic attack someday, if it hasn't already.

### Jeff Rosenstock, _WORRY._ (2016)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3395996241_16.jpg"></p>

On New Year's Eve, Sean Craig published this [essay](https://www.mixedfrequencies.org/jeff-rosenstock-worry) on why WORRY. was his album of the decade. It nicely summarizes why I feel exactly the same.

### Bomb the Music Industry!, _Vacation_ (2011)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://s9.limitedrun.com/images/1317818/v600_vaca430.jpg"></p>

Maybe it's cheating to list Jeff twice, but Vacation was the salve I needed after finishing three horrendous years in Boston. Through punk salvos, the album preaches serenity and empathy (especially [The Shit That You Hate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3yod_H2XU8)) and helped me move on.

### Girlpool, _What Chaos is Imaginary_ (2019)

<p align="left"><img width="400" src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2811898856_16.jpg"></p>

Truly beautiful melodies paired with haunting, dissociated lyrics. I listened to this album for much of 2019 and closed out the decade with it. Not enough time has passed to know what this means, but I'm looking forward to finding out.

------------------

## Honorable Mentions

There are a couple of albums that, for completeness' sake, I feel like I should mention. These albums made less of a lasting impact, but nevertheless occupied a particular time and space in my head in the 2010s.

#### Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros, _Here_ (2012)

For what it's worth, I spent a good chunk of 2013 listening to Edward Sharpe. I was trying to recreate a magical moment from that summer when I saw them on a mountain top in Floyd, Virginia.

#### Death Cab for Cutie, _Transatlanticism Demos_ (2013)

I loved DCFC in high school and was so excited when the demos were released. They are worth mentioning solely because they can still make me cry.

#### Mountain Goats, _Beat the Champ_ (2014)

It felt strange not to include the Mountain Goats in this list, as I listened to so much of them this decade. The albums after 2009's The Life of the World to Come have resonated with me less though. That said, I still spent a lot of time Beat the Champ, whose wrestling-inspired lyrics still make me pop.

#### Phoebe Bridgers, _Stranger in the Alps_ (2017)

Phoebe Bridgers is truly incredible. Between her solo work, Boygenius, and Better Oblivion Community Center, I spent much of 2018-2019 having my heart wrenched by her lyrics.

#### Car Seat Headrest, _Twin Fantasy_ (2011/2018)

I lost whole months of the decade to Twin Fantasy in its original and rerecorded versions and spent whole days just listening to [Beach Life-In-Death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbDNP9R23h4) on repeat.
