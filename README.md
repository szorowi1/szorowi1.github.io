=================

My personal website, i.e. a home for ramblings en route to the PhD.

Hosted via Github Pages, styled with Jekyll and the [Indigo theme](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). Customization inspired by [Eliseo Papa](https://github.com/elipapa/elipapa.github.io). Mathjax figured out thanks to [DeepLearningThesis](http://deeplearningthesis.com/jekyll/mathematics/programming/2018/01/14/setting-up-jekyll.html).

## Notes to self

Projects are added to the `_projects` folder. Blog posts are added to the `_posts` folder.

To update software:

    bundle update

To preview locally:

    bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml
